    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p style="font-size:18px">The plot focuses on the activities of the battalion medics in Battalion 33 of the Paratroopers in the IDF (Israeli defense forces).
  <br>The series opens with a scene in which Amir, a fighter from the armored corps, experiences hallucinations and opens fire in the direction of the battalion's ambulance. Amir collapses on an iron rod piercing his lungs, loses consciousness and is finally gets hospitalized. <br>It is <i>alleged</i> that he is allergic to cortisone and his behavior is due to an allergic reaction to the substance received by Alex, the battalion doctor. He is replaced by Ivri, a reserve officer who has signed for six months. 
</p>
<p style="font-size:18px">Daniel, who is deeply connected to Alex, and his colleagues, are working to investigate the truth about Amir's collapse, hoping to bring their doctor back to the unit.
  Later, Daniel discovers that there is something greater and mysterious behind Alex's deposition. Over time, Daniel, Polachek, Ben Lulu and Lia (the main characters) discover a series of life-threatening corruption among prominent IDF officers. Apperently Alex's family, the doctor who was ousted from the battalion, tests sarin on the soldiers to develop anti-gas drugs. The IDF soldiers think that they only receive stimulants.
<br>All characters, in addition to investigating the corruption, play parts in affairs and romances throughout the show.
